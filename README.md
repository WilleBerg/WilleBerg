Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! I am WilleBerg, a software developer with experience in developing Discord bots, web APIs, and games. I have a strong background in programming languages including JavaScript, Python, C++, C#, and MongoDB, as well as experience in C and Assembly from university projects.

My projects showcase my skills and attention to detail, including a multi-functional Discord bot that plays music and communicates with websites through APIs. A chess game developed, as well as a 2D pixelart game with Monogame and C#. I have also contributed to several Advent of Code challenges using C++.

If you're interested in collaborating or just want to talk technology, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting my profile.
